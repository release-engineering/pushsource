Quick Start
-----------

Install pushsource from PyPI:

::

    pip install pushsource

In your python code, obtain a :class:`~pushsource.Source` instance,
iterate over the source to obtain push items, and perform desired operations
according to their type and attributes:

.. code-block:: python

    from pushsource import Source, RpmPushItem
    import logging

    with Source.get('koji:https://koji.fedoraproject.org/kojihub?rpm=rpm1,rpm2,...') as source:
        for item in source:
            if isinstance(item, RpmPushItem):
                # do something with RPMs
                publish_rpm(item)
            else:
                # don't know what to do
                logging.getLogger().warning("Unexpected item: %s", item)

For more information, see the :ref:`userguide`.
