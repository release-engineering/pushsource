        Many pushsource backends will produce push items with empty checksum attributes,
        since checksum calculation may be expensive and may not be required in all cases.

        The rule of thumb is that a pushsource will only provide checksums if they were
        available in metadata, so that reading the push item's file was unnecessary.
        For example:

        - with ``errata`` push source, checksums are generally available by default, because
          Errata Tool itself provides checksums on the files contained in an advisory.
        - with ``staged`` push source, checksums are unavailable by default, because the
          sums can only be calculated by reading file content from the staging area.

        Where checksums are needed, this utility method may be used to ensure they are present
        regardless of the push source used.

        This method entails reading the entire content of the file referenced
        by this push item, and may be:

        - slow: may need to read a large file from a remote system, e.g. from an NFS volume.
        - error-prone: reads from a remote system might fail.

        As such, when dealing with a large number of push items, you may want to consider
        using multiple threads to parallelize calls to ``with_checksums``, and retrying
        failing operations.

        If checksums are already present or if this item does not reference a file, this
        method is a no-op and returns the current push item, unmodified.

        Returns:
            :class:`~pushsource.PushItem`
                A copy of this item, guaranteed either to have non-empty :meth:`md5sum` and
                :meth:`sha256sum` attributes, or an empty :meth:`src` attribute (denoting that
                the item does not reference a file).
